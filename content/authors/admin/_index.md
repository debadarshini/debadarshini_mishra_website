I am a graduate student at the University of Connecticut, pursuing a PhD in Physics. My research interests broadly lie in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, with a focus on ultrafast molecular dynamics using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. I am currently working on imaging ultrafast molecular dynamics using various techniques such as photoion and photoelectron spectroscopy. I have experience working with various spectrometers such as COLTRIMS, VMI, and magnetic bottle spectrometer. For these experiments, I use various light sources such as high-power table-top pulsed lasers, free electron lasers and synchrotrons.
